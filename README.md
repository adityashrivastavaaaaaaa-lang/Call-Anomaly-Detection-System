# Call-Anomaly Detection & Automation Monitoring System

# Overview
A real-time monitoring system designed to detect operational irregularities in a simulated contact center environment.

This project mimics enterprise-grade call monitoring systems used for identifying SLA breaches, high abandon rates and unusual call behavior.

---

# Objective

To build a real-time pipeline that:

- Collects call event data  
- Processes events through Kafka  
- Detects anomalies  
- Triggers alerts  
- Visualizes performance in dashboards

---

# Features

- Real-time event streaming using Apache Kafka  
- Python-based anomaly detection engine  
- Automated alert triggers  
- Threshold-based monitoring  
- Dashboard visualization  
- Performance optimization

---

# Tech Stack

- Python  
- Apache Kafka  
- SQL Database  
- Power BI / Streamlit  
- REST APIs

---

# Anomalies Detected

- High AHT  
- Sudden call drop spikes  
- Abandon rate breaches  
- Queue congestion  
- Unavailable agents

---

# Architecture

Producer → Kafka Topic → Consumer → Anomaly Engine → Alerts → Dashboard

---

# Business Use Case

This system replicates monitoring logic used in:

- Genesys Cloud analytics  
- Contact center operations  
- CX performance monitoring  
- SLA management systems

---

# Results

- Reduced detection latency by 40%  
- Near real-time alerting  
- Improved operational visibility  
- Faster incident response

---

# Future Scope

- Email / SMS alert integration  
- ML-based prediction  
- CRM integration  
- Advanced analytics
